A top down view 2d game made with unity 4.3
===========================================

It's a repository for my second experience creating a 2D game with Unity 4.3. This project have followed this [tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/61532/unity-2d-tutorial-getting-started), with some changes.

My thanks to [Ray Wenderlich](http://www.raywenderlich.com/) and specially to [@ChrisLaPollo](http://www.raywenderlich.com/u/clapollo).
